Term insurance plans offer high coverage at low premiums, making them an economical choice for many.

For example, a healthy 30-year-old non-smoking male can purchase a term policy with a coverage amount of Rs. 1 crore for 20 years. By paying a premium of just Rs. 725 per month, he can ensure his family maintains their current lifestyle in case of his untimely death. Note that the premium may vary depending on the payment option selected by the policyholder.`,
